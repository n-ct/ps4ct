
Merkle tree visualizer

The Merkle tree visualizer is within the trillian server files. An example of the directory is below.

/go/src/github.com/zorawar87/trillian/docs/merkletree/treetex#

You will also need texlive. It is quite sizable 500+ Mb. So be on a fast connection.

apt install texlive-full

Instructions on how to run it and features are available at

You will need to copy the file out of docker onto your system to see the pdf and jpg files. Below is a sample command 

Docker cp source destination

docker cp 0e1e046178b2:/go/src/github.com/zorawar87/trillian/docs/merkletree/treetex/texput.pdf /Users/Dave/Downloads
