
Merkle tree visualizer

ABOUT
This is a program for visualizing merkle trees. As of now, there is no functionality that is known to query a MySQL database.
This is purely for creating graphics.

INTRO

The Merkle tree visualizer is within the trillian server files. An example of the directory is below.

/go/src/github.com/zorawar87/trillian/docs/merkletree/treetex#

You will also need texlive. It is quite sizable, so be on a fast connection.

apt install texlive-full


INSTRUCTIONS

1: From the directory you will have to type 

go run main.go --argumentshere | pdflatex 

  The  "| pdflatex" outputs it into a pdf format. After you run the command with arguents, you will get an output of "textpuf.pdf" 


Note: FullerInstructions on how to run it and features are available at

2: You will need to copy the file out of docker onto your system to see the pdf and jpg files. Below is a sample command that must be run outside of the container. 


Docker cp containername:SourceFileWithPathName DestinationPath

docker cp 0e1e046178b2:/go/src/github.com/zorawar87/trillian/docs/merkletree/treetex/texput.pdf /Users/Dave/Downloads

2a: If you are unsure what container you are in. Just look at the command line and and you will notice a string of alphanumericas right after the "root@"

2b: If you are unsure what directory you are in, just use the 'pwd' command.
